                <h3>Running Stitch - Difficulty: <span style="color:green;">Easy</span></h3>
                        <h4>The running stitch is similar to basting stitch, but with smaller stitches, roughly 1/8”, and a locking stitch at the end. This is great for quickly mending a seam that’s come apart, or for small spaces that are hard to reach with a sewing machine.</h4>
                        <br>
                            <img src="run1.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>Running stitches like the ones above in green thread are normally what you'll use to sew a basic seam. When sewn in longer lengths, this stitch can be used as a basting stitch to temporarily hold two pieces of fabric in place. If you need a stronger seam, stitch shorter stitches.
                                </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <img src="run2.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>Thread the needle and tie a knot in the end of the thread. Bring the needle out through the fabric from the backside, so the end knot stays hidden.
                                </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <img src="run3.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>Move ahead a 1/2 inch or so, and push the needle back down through to the backside of the fabric.
                                </p>
                        <br>

                            <img src="run4.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>Continuing in a straight line, move the needle ahead another 1/2 inch and bring it back up through the back to the top of the fabric.
                                </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            <img src="run5.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>Continue steps 1-3, keeping the stitches equally spaced until your fabrics are joined along the seam. When finished, the stitch will look like a long line of dashes.
                                </p>
                        <br>

                <h3>Back Stitch - Difficulty: <span style="color:gold;">Medium</span></h3>
                        <h4>The back stitch is a very strong seam. It is typically used for heavy or dense fabric, or even to repair a seam. Start from right to left.</h4>
                        <br>
                            <img src="back1.jfif" width=400px align="center">
                                <p>This stitch (made with pink thread in the photo above) is a small, very strong stitch that is great for sewing together seams that need lots of strength. You can also use this stitch for basic embroidery- it's useful when embroidering typography or other illustrations for home decor.
                                </p>

                                <p>Send the needle back down into the fabric (following in a straight line) about a half inch from the first stitch. You're essentially making a running stitch at this point.

                        <h4>The blanket stitch is meant to edge fabrics and create pretty patterns on sewing projects. It is ideal for finishing off a blanket or minimizing wearing and fraying along edges.</h4>

                                <p>The blanket stitch (pictured above in pink) is a decorative way of joining fabrics together. You've most likely seen this stitch before, as it's commonly used to sew appliqué and to finish the edges of blankets and felted toys. This stitch is meant to be seen, so use whatever thread color looks best with your project.
